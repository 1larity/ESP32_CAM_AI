"""
ESP32-CAM MDI Viewer (Qt)

Multi-document interface (MDI) master application to manage multiple
ESP32-CAM feeds as independent, floating, resizable windows inside a
single main window. Includes a standard toolbar with camera management
and recording controls. Supports basic MJPEG streaming with optional
Basic-Auth or token, plus pre-buffered video capture per camera.

Dependencies (install on your PC):
  - pip install PySide6 requests opencv-python numpy

Notes:
  - This is a first pass skeleton designed to get the MDI scaffolding,
    multi-camera streaming, and pre-buffered recording in place.
  - Face/pet recognition and the advanced UI from cam_ai.py can be
    integrated in phased steps by adding overlays and per-camera tool
    panels.
